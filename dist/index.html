                        <li>Immediately following the appointment, the tattooed area will appear to be dark,slightly bold in color and more sharply defined. Do not apply any cosmetics in this area for 14 days. If your skin starts to feel tight/dry around day 3-4, you may use a small amount of the aftercare ointment provided to you. Oily skin clients are asked to blot the eyebrow area every2-3 hours with blotting paper until fully healed. Please be sure to follow all aftercare instructions provided to you.</li>
                        <li>During the healing period, there may be some flaking of the skin. This is completely normal. If there is some flaking, please do not pick, pull or rub. Allow the flakes to come off on their own. This process can take up to 2 weeks. IMPORTANT: Once the flakes have fallen off, a shiny layer of healing skin will completely cover the tattooed area. It may appear as though the tattoo has completely disappeared or lightened. Within 1-2 weeks, the color will slowly reappear at a lighter shade as your skin regenerates.</li>
                        <li>The complete healing process takes approximately 6 weeks, at which time the true color of the tattoo is evident. During this process, your tattoo will soften/lighten. Be patient, even if you think too much color has been lost.Keep in mind that the skin regenerates between 18-45 days, your skin will need time to fully heal. Be sure to follow up with your 6-8 week touch up.</li>

                <p>Permanent Eyeliner is a cosmetic tattoo, which allows your top lashes to have a more full and darker effect by simply outlining and framing the eye. The goal at the end of this process is to allow the permanent eyeliner to sit directly on the top lash line, blending into the top lashes. The Permanent Eyeliner Services give room for advantages such as: no smudging, will always have its beautifully drawn shape, and it cuts down on daily makeup routines.</p>
